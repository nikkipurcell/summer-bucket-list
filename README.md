# summer-bucket-list

I created this simple page to for a reminder of all the fun things to be done in summer. Just hover over any image to see the bucket list suggestion. To view the website visit: [Happy Garden](https://nikkipurcell.github.io/happy-garden/).

## Technology Used
This site is basic HTML. The trick is in the clever CSS. I got the inspiration from an old CSS Tricks demo.
